In the last episode we talked about the data representation of integer, a kind
of fixed-point numbers. Today we're going to learn about floating-point numbers. 

Floating-point numbers are used to _approximate_ real numbers. Because of the 
fact that all the stuffs in computers are, eventually, just a limited sequence 
of bits. The representation of floating-point number had to made trade-offs 
between _ranges_ and _precision_.

Due to its computational complexities, CPU also have a dedicated set of 
instructions to accelerate on floating-point arithmetics.
